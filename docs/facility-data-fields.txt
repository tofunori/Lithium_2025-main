GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH PROMPT TEMPLATE
====================================

Use this prompt structure for comprehensive facility research:

"Research [Company Name]'s lithium battery recycling facility in [Location]. Provide the following information in a structured format:

1. Full facility address and coordinates
2. Current operational status and when it became effective
3. Annual processing capacity in metric tonnes
4. Primary recycling technology and process description
5. Types of batteries accepted (feedstock) and materials recovered (products)
6. Total investment amount and number of jobs created
7. Environmental impact and sustainability features
8. Key timeline events from announcement to current status
9. Contact information if available
10. Links to official sources, press releases, and permits

Include specific details about the technology category (Hydrometallurgy, Pyrometallurgy, Mechanical, or Hybrid) and any unique features of this facility."

====================================
DATA QUALITY CHECKLIST
