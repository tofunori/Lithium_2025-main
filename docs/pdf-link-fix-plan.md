# PDF Link Fix Plan (Documents Page)

## 1. Problem

PDF links (both the file name link and the eye icon action button) in the Documents page (`frontend/src/pages/DocumentsPage.jsx`) do not work. Clicking them has no effect, instead of opening the PDF in a new tab as expected.

## 2. Analysis

*   The links in `DocumentsPage.jsx` are standard HTML anchor tags (`<a href={item.url} target="_blank">`).
*   The `item.url` value used in the `href` attribute is fetched directly from the `url` field of the corresponding document in the Firestore `doc_items` collection.
*   The `getFolderContents` function in `frontend/src/firebase.js` retrieves this data from Firestore without modifying or generating new URLs.
*   Since both links using the same `item.url` fail, the most likely cause is that the `url` field stored in Firestore for the affected PDF documents is missing, incorrect, or invalid (e.g., expired permissions, points to a non-existent object).

## 3. Verification (Manual/Developer Task)

*   **Inspect Firestore:** Directly examine the `doc_items` collection in the Firebase console or using appropriate tools.
*   **Locate Documents:** Find the Firestore documents corresponding to the non-working PDF files (e.g., "baum-et-al-2022...pdf").
*   **Check URL Field:** Verify the value of the `url` field for these documents. Confirm if it is missing, null, malformed, or points to an inaccessible Storage object.

## 4. Solution Strategy

### 4.1 Fix Existing Data (Primary Fix)

*   For each affected Firestore document where the `url` is invalid:
    *   Determine the correct Firebase Storage path for the file (this might be stored in another field or inferred from the `name` and `parentId`).
    *   Use the Firebase Admin SDK or a dedicated script (with appropriate permissions) to call `getDownloadURL()` for the correct Storage path, generating a fresh, valid download URL.
    *   Update the `url` field in the corresponding Firestore document with the correct, newly generated download URL.

### 4.2 Prevent Future Issues (Optional but Recommended)

*   Review the `handleFileUpload` function in `frontend/src/pages/DocumentsPage.jsx` (lines 254-309).
*   Enhance error handling:
    *   Ensure `getDownloadURL` succeeds before attempting to save to Firestore.
    *   Log errors clearly if `getDownloadURL` fails or if the Firestore write fails.
    *   Consider preventing the Firestore document creation/update if a valid URL cannot be obtained.

## 5. Implementation Handoff

*   Switch to **Code mode**.
*   Provide the Code mode assistant with:
    *   The path to `frontend/src/pages/DocumentsPage.jsx` for reviewing/improving the upload logic.
    *   Instructions to fix the `url` fields in the existing Firestore `doc_items` documents for the broken PDFs. This will likely require manual updates via the Firebase console or a script. The script would need the correct Storage paths for the files.
