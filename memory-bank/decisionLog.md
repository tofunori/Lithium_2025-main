## Decision

*   [2025-04-17 20:08:30] - Redesign `FacilityDetailPage.tsx` to use a multi-column layout (responsive) instead of tabs.

## Rationale

*   Improves information visibility on wider screens by utilizing space better than tabs or a single long page.
*   Provides a clear structure for organizing diverse information sections.
*   Responsive design ensures usability on mobile devices by stacking columns.

## Implementation Details

*   Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the layout.
*   Implement in-page editing: Toggle between display sections and form sections using an `isEditing` state.
*   Reuse existing `*FormSection` components for editing.
*   See `docs/facility-detail-redesign-plan.md` for full details.
