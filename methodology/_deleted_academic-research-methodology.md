# Systematic Methodology for Identifying and Cataloging Electric Vehicle Lithium-ion Battery Recycling Facilities in North America: A Mixed-Method Approach Using AI-Assisted Discovery and Multi-Source Verification

## Abstract

This study presents a novel mixed-method research methodology for systematically identifying and cataloging electric vehicle (EV) lithium-ion battery recycling facilities across North America. The methodology employs a two-phase approach: (1) AI-assisted facility discovery using large language model technology (Gemini Deep Research), and (2) multi-source verification through traditional web-based research methods. The developed framework addresses the current gap in comprehensive databases of recycling infrastructure and provides a replicable methodology for facility mapping in emerging industrial sectors. Initial validation suggests the methodology can achieve 80%+ verification rates while identifying 25-35 facilities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico within a four-week research cycle.

## 1. Introduction and Literature Review

### 1.1 Background and Research Problem

The rapid adoption of electric vehicles has created an emerging industrial ecosystem for lithium-ion battery recycling, yet comprehensive mapping of recycling infrastructure remains limited (Chen et al., 2023; International Energy Agency, 2024). Existing databases are fragmented, industry-specific, or lack systematic verification protocols. This study addresses the methodological challenge of systematically identifying and cataloging recycling facilities in a rapidly evolving industrial landscape.

### 1.2 Theoretical Framework

This methodology is grounded in systematic review principles (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007) and multi-source triangulation theory (Denzin, 1978). The approach adapts established systematic literature review techniques to industrial facility identification, incorporating emerging AI-assisted research tools within a rigorous verification framework.

### 1.3 Literature Gaps and Research Justification

Current approaches to industrial facility mapping rely primarily on:
- Government regulatory databases (limited scope and delayed updates)
- Industry association directories (membership-based, incomplete)
- Academic studies (small sample sizes, specific regional focus)
- Commercial databases (proprietary, expensive, variable quality)

The proposed methodology addresses these limitations by combining AI-assisted discovery with systematic multi-source verification, providing a replicable framework for comprehensive facility identification.

## 2. Research Design and Methodology

### 2.1 Methodological Approach

This study employs a convergent mixed-method design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2017) integrating:
- **Qualitative discovery phase**: AI-assisted facility identification using natural language processing
- **Quantitative verification phase**: Systematic multi-source validation with structured data collection
- **Data integration phase**: Triangulation and standardization of facility information

### 2.2 Research Questions

**Primary Research Question**: What is the most effective methodology for systematically identifying and verifying EV lithium-ion battery recycling facilities across North America?

**Secondary Research Questions**:
1. What verification rate can be achieved using multi-source triangulation?
2. How do AI-assisted discovery methods compare to traditional search strategies?
3. What standardized data collection framework ensures research replicability?

### 2.3 Scope and Geographic Boundaries

**Geographic Scope**: North America (United States, Canada, Mexico)
**Facility Types**: Commercial and pilot-scale lithium-ion battery recycling facilities
**Technology Scope**: All recycling technology approaches (hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, mechanical processing)
